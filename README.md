# Stats170B Final Project
Attached are the different scripts for carrying out the final project. 
To run the Notebook.ipynb, there are three associated csv's that need to be utilized: 'qb_by_year.csv' and 'season_qb.csv' are used for initial visualizations while 'qb_sample_data.csv' is the sample data that is used when running the ARIMA model that is conducted in Notebook.ipynb.
