# Stats170B Final Project
Attached are the different scripts for carrying out the final project. 
To run the Notebook.ipynb, there are three associated csv's that need to be utilized: 'qb_by_year.csv' and 'season_qb.csv' are used for initial visualizations while 'qb_sample_data.csv' is the sample data that is used when running the ARIMA model that is conducted in Notebook.ipynb. 

If desired, feel free to visit some of the other Python notebooks that are described below: 

  MainPlayerStats.ipynb is a script that scrabes pro-football-reference.com for the statistics of interest in our project. 
  PCA.ipynb is a script that utilizes Principal Component Analysis to examine the relationship of players' performances with their teams' offensive statistics in the past season and their opponent's defensive statistics in the past season.
